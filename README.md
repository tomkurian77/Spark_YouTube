# Spark_YouTube
YouTube Data_SET case study using Apache Spark
Hi Friends This is my first project in apache spark
It's the analysis of the youtube dataset

The Requirements:
1) Load the given data into HDFS in parquet format so that data can be accessed using HIVE tables with parquet schema.
2) Data loading should be done with Spark
3) Another program should be written to find out the answers of the given questions and that result data needs to be loaded to another HIVE table(Data should be in parquet format ). This is the data aggregation stage. Spark SQL can be used for this.
4) Results should be able to query from the aggregate HIVE table(second HIVE table).
